Creating a LeetCode-Style Web App with React and GitHub Pages
1. Project Setup
Create a new React app:
Bash
npx create-react-app leetcode-app
Use code with caution.

Navigate to the project directory:
Bash
cd leetcode-app
Use code with caution.

2. Install Dependencies
Install necessary libraries:
Bash
npm install axios react-router-dom @chakra-ui/react @chakra-ui/react-icons
Use code with caution.

axios: For making API requests to your AI service.
react-router-dom: For routing between different pages (e.g., difficulty selection, problem display, solution).
@chakra-ui/react, @chakra-ui/react-icons: For a pre-built UI component library to create a visually appealing interface.
3. AI Integration
Choose an AI service:
Consider options like OpenAI (GPT-4), Hugging Face Transformers, or Google AI.
Each service has its own API and usage guidelines.
Set up API key:
Create an account with your chosen AI service and obtain an API key.
Store the API key securely (e.g., in environment variables or a secrets manager).

Let's have the user provide an api key and select their service. By default, let's use openai

4. App Structure
Create components:
DifficultySelection: For selecting difficulty levels.
ProblemDisplay: For displaying the generated problem.
AnswerInput: For user input.
Solution: For showing the solution.
Set up routing:
Use react-router-dom to create routes for different pages (e.g., /difficulty, /problem, /solution).
5. App Logic
Difficulty selection:
Allow users to choose from different difficulty levels (e.g., easy, medium, hard).
Problem generation:
Make an API call to your AI service, passing the selected difficulty as a parameter.
Parse the response to extract the problem statement and expected output.
Answer input:
Provide a field for the user to enter their solution.
Answer checking:
Compare the user's answer with the expected output.
Provide feedback on whether the answer is correct.
Solution display:
If the user's answer is incorrect or they want to see the solution, display a detailed explanation.
6. UI Design
Use Chakra UI components:
Leverage Chakra UI's pre-built components (e.g., Button, Input, Text) to create a visually appealing interface.
Customize the components' styles to match your desired design.
7. Deployment to GitHub Pages
Create a GitHub repository:
Set up a new GitHub repository for your project.
Deploy to GitHub Pages:
Use a tool like gh-pages or a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically deploy your app to GitHub Pages when you push changes to your repository.
Example Code Structure:

JavaScript
// App.js
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import DifficultySelection from './components/DifficultySelection';
import ProblemDisplay from './components/ProblemDisplay';
import AnswerInput from './components/AnswerInput';
import Solution from './components/Solution';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<DifficultySelection />} />
        <Route path="/problem" element={<ProblemDisplay />} />
        <Route path="/solution" element={<Solution />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
Use code with caution.

By following these steps and leveraging the power of React, AI integration, and GitHub Pages, you can create a dynamic and engaging LeetCode-style web app.
